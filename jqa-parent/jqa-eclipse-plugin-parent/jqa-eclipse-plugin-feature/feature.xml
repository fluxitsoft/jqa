      JQA is an open source tool for QA of Java applications. It is considered a supplement to tools like PMD (http://pmd.sourceforge.net/) or Checkstyle (http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/) because it allows to write rules that exploit the bytecode engine capabilities for high-level architecture validations.
