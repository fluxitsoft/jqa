# Java Quality Assurance (JQA) [![](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jbaris/jqa.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/jbaris/jqa)
JQA is an open source tool for QA of Java applications. It is considered a supplement to tools like PMD (http://pmd.sourceforge.net) or Firebugs (http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/) because it allows to write rules that exploit the bytecode engine capabilities.

## Features
JQA is integrated with:
* Maven 2 (http://maven.apache.org/)    
* Sonar (http://www.sonarsource.org/)

JQA allows you to write rules to check your classes regarding:
* Naming
* Typing
* Usages
* Allocations
* Exception throwing
* Abstraction

## Screenshots
[Here](http://github.com/jbaris/jqa/wiki/Screenshots) are few screenshots of JQA in action.

## Requirements
* Java 5 or later
* Maven 2
